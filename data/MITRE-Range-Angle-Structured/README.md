# MITRE Range-Angle (Structured)

**Overview:**

This dataset contains measurements following the [_Range-Angle Collection Protocol_](https://mitll.github.io/PACT/files/Structured%20Contact%20Tracing%20Protocol,%20V.%202.0%20(1.5).pdf) collected by MITRE employees.

For measurments using two iPhones, the BluetoothProximity app was used to broadcast the BLE advertisement from one device following the standard test protocol.  For measurements using an iPhone and an Android device, the nRF Connect app was used on the Andriod device to broadcast the BLE advertisement.
